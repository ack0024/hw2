    <p class="m-8">Blaise and Alexandra first met during undergrad at Penn State when their path's crossed through a student organization. They quickly learned that they have many things in common, one being food! </p>
    <p class="m-8">When not studying or out with friends, Blaise and Alexandra would cook and try out new recipes together. Both with families orginally from Italy, one of their favorite cusines to cook together was Italian, specifically of the Southern Regions.</p>
    <p class="m-8">Over the years, their passion of cooking continued to grow. Fast forward 9 years later, and they decided to turn their hobbies into a business! Although their weeks invovle 9-5 jobs, their weekend's involve all things DeLuca's Delights!</p>

    <p class="font-bold text-center m-8">We look forward to serving you and we hope you enjoy our food as much as we do!</p>
